## UseCase  
Style guides are created by UI/UX designers using softwares like figma, adobeXD, invision, etc. These style guides are translated into reusuable code with the aid of developers. Thus, increasing the dependency of UI/UX designers on the development team. The idea of this project is to create a interface with following capabilities
- Allow UI/UX designers to maintain style guides in indepedence of development team
- Translate style guides into .css file to be used by the development team
- Delivery of .css by downloding file, over cdn or other means
- Create web page of style guide to be used by other teams
